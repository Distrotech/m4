GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro
processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters
to macros).  `m4' also has built-in functions for including files,
running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU
`m4' for generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

GNU `m4' has been originally written by René Seindal, from Denmark.

This release is a development release.  Last stable release is 1.4.

If GNU `m4' is meant to serve GNU `autoconf', beware that `m4'
should be fully installed *prior to* configuring `autoconf' itself.

In the subdirectory `examples' you will find various m4 files, ranging
from trivial test files to rather advanced macros.  If you intend to
use m4 seriously, you might find useful material down there.

See file `COPYING' for copying conditions.
See file `INSTALL' for compilation and installation instructions.
See file `ABOUT-NLS' for how to customize this program to your language.
See file `NEWS' for a list of major changes in the current release.
See file `THANKS' for a list of contributors.

By using `./configure --with-gmp, you get an multiple precision integral
and rational arithmetic in eval.  The implementation depends on GNU gmp
v2.

By using `./configure --with-modules, you get the possibility of using
dynamic modules.  The implementation depends on dlopen(3) interface.
This might change or go away, so don't count on it yet.

By using `./configure --enable-changeword', you get an experimental
feature which allows for changing the syntax of what is a "word" in
`m4'.  THIS WILL PROBABLY GO AWAY, so don't count on it.  Some of the
same things can be achieved with `changesyntax' at a much better speed.

Send bug reports, comments or ideas to `bug-m4@gnu.org'.  A bug report
is an adequate description of the problem: your input, what you
expected, what you got, and why this is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but
they only describe a solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to
infer.  Don't forget all relevant information about your operating
system, compiler, libraries, ...
