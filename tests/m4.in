# - If configure --disable-shared, then src/m4 is a real program,
#   neutralize the full path display
# - otherwise, it is a  libtool wrapper, relying on PATH to execute the
#   actual program, either lt-m4, or m4.
#
# - In both cases, beware of .exe.
# - Also, when tracing modules, lines of the form
#      m4debug: module m4: opening file `m4.a'
#   must be reduced, since module names are platform dependent.
