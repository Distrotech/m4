# Certain portions of the Autotest source text are designed to be

# This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autotest

# special exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as

# its output some of the text that was the non-data portion of the

# moves or copies text from the non-data portions to the data
# portions.)  If your modification has such potential, you must delete
# any notice of this special exception to the GPL from your modified
