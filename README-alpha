This is a alpha version of GNU m4.

Please see the file TODO for a list of open problems and known bugs.

Send bug reports, comments or ideas to `bug-m4@gnu.org'.  A bug report
is an adequate description of the problem: your input, what you
expected, what you got, and why this is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but
they only describe a solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to
infer.  Don't forget all relevant information about your operating
system, compiler, libraries, ...
