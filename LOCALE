This GNU package is `localizable'.

It can be made to speak your native language (or mother tongue).
If you are lucky, someone already did it for you.  Check in the
distribution for `??.tt' files.  `??' is usually one of:

	de  for German
	fr  for French
	nl  for Dutch
	sv  for Swedish

If your language is already supported, usage is quite simple.
Let's suppose, here, that you speak German.  At the shell prompt,
merely execute `setenv LANG de' (in csh) or `export LANG; LANG=de'
(in sh).  You may want to put this in your .login or .profile file.

If your language is not supported, you have to work a bit for it.
Let's suppose again that you speak German.  Eventually, when the GNU
locale package will have been published, you will follow these steps:

1) Check with the maintainer if the work has been, or is being done.
2) Ensure that GNU locale has been installed on your site.
3) In the distribution, initialize `de.tt' by copying `fr.tt'.
4) Carefully edit `de.tt', replacing French parts by German parts.
5) Edit `Makefile.in', adding `de.msg' to the `CATALOGS =' line.
6) You do not need to reconfigure again.  Execute `make install'.
7) Use `setenv LANG de', and just use the programs as usual.
8) Send `de.tt' to the maintainer, to be later distributed in GNU.

But for the time being, GNU local package is still in alpha pretest,
so you are not completely free of me yet!  Follow these steps:

1) Check with the maintainer if the work has been, or is being done.
2) In the distribution, initialize `de.tt' by copying `fr.tt'.
3) Carefully edit `de.tt', replacing French parts by German parts.
4) Send `de.tt' to the maintainer, then wait for `de.msg' in return.
5) Install `de.msg' as `/usr/local/share/locale/de/PACKAGE.msg'.
6) Use `setenv LANG de', and just use the programs as usual.

In step 5), of course, replace PACKAGE by the GNU package name, which
is usually the first word in the name of the distributed tar file.
