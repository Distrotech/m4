GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro
processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters
to macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files,
running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU
`m4' for generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

GNU `m4' has been originally written by Rene' Seindal, from Denmark.

GNU `m4' has a web site at http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/.

If GNU `m4' is meant to serve GNU `autoconf', beware that `m4'
should be fully installed *prior to* configuring `autoconf' itself.
Likewise, if you intend on hacking GNU `m4' from CVS, the bootstrap
process requires that you first install a released copy of GNU `m4'.

In the subdirectories `tests' and `examples' you will find various m4
files, ranging from trivial test files to rather advanced macros.  If
you intend to use m4 seriously, you might find useful material down
there.

See file `COPYING' for copying conditions.
See file `INSTALL' for compilation and installation instructions.
See file `ABOUT-NLS' for how to customize this program to your language.
See file `NEWS' for a list of major changes in the current release.
See file `AUTHORS' for the names of maintainers.
See file `THANKS' for a list of contributors.

By using `./configure --with-gmp, you get multiple precision integral
and rational arithmetic using mpeval.  The implementation depends on the
GNU gmp v2 library.

By using `./configure --with-modules=`foo bar baz', you get an m4 with only
the named modules preloaded.  The default modules (preloaded if you do not
use this option) are sufficient to do the job of GNU m4-1.4.  Additional
modules may be desirable, or necessary if libltdl does not support your
host architecture.  The implementation uses libltdl interface, details of
which are in the libtool manual.  See file `modules/README' for a more
detailed description.

By using `./configure --with-dmalloc', GNU m4 is linked with Gray
Watson's dmalloc package.  It is a debugging option for finding memory
management problems.  Gray Watson's dmalloc package is available at
ftp://ftp.letters.com/src/dmalloc/dmalloc.tar.gz.

GNU M4 uses GNU Libtool in order to build shared libraries on a
variety of systems.  While this is very nice for making usable
binaries, it can be a pain when trying to debug a program. For that
reason, compilation of shared libraries can be turned off by
specifying the `--disable-shared' option to `configure'.

Send bug reports, comments or ideas to `bug-m4@gnu.org'.  A bug report
is an adequate description of the problem: your input, what you
expected, what you got, and why this is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but
they only describe a solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to
infer.  Don't forget all relevant information about your operating
system, compiler, libraries, ...

If you wish to run bootstrap, the released versions of autoconf,
automake, and libtool are missing some functionality we need.  You
will need a CVS build of libtool head (1.5.x does not have enough
functionality), and use the 2.59d snapshot of autoconf or a CVS
build.  If you do not use a CVS build of automake, you can instead
patch automake-1.9.5 or 1.9.6 according to the patch below:
